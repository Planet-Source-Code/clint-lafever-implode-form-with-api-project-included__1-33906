## Implode Form \(with API\) Project Included


</div>

### Description

I posted this code yesterday but I had comments on it and emails sent directly to me from my web site asking how to use it. Guess that is the problem when you only post the sub routine. So, here is the code again, but this time with a demo project. This uses the API to simulate the minimize effect you see of a form shrinking to the taskbar, but with this code you can shrink it to any place you want, like itself to show it imploding, or the tray, or to the mouse.
